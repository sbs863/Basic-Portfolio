			<p>
				First and foremost thanks for taking the time to look at my work. Everyone hates writing about themselves, I'm no exception. I'll try to keep this brief so that you have more time to examine the content I've created. I graduated in 2013 from UT Austin with a Bachelor degree in Environmental Science and Sustainability. It took a little time, but I landed a job in my field and have been comfortable for the last few years. However, it was a bit of a dead end, and I didn't have much of a desire to return for a Master's. With many friends, and some family, working in tech, coupled with a lifelong captivation with computers, I decided to embark on the road to becoming a full stack web developer. As of right now I'm exactly one week into my training, so please forgive any glaring errors or semantic misteps.
